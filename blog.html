                    Difference Between Local Storage and Session Storage?

                            access to the
                            Document’s local
                            storage object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to
                            sessionStorage,
                            except that localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is when the
                            page is
                            closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data

                            a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito session).</small></p>
                    <p>Local storage has 4 methods:</p>
                    <p>1. setItem() Method – <small>This method takes two parameters one is key and another one is
                            value. It
                            is
                            used to store the value in a particular location with the name of the
                            key.</small> localStorage.setItem(key, value)</p>

                    <p>2. getItem() Method – <small>This method takes one parameter that is key which is used to get the
                            value
                            stored with a particular key name.</small> localStorage.getItem(key)</p>

                    <p>3. removeItem() Method – <small>This is method is used to remove the value stored in the memory
                            in
                            reference to key.</small> localStorage.removeItem(key)</p>

                    <p>4. clear() Method – <small>This method is used to clear all the values stored in

                    <p class="text-xl mt-5">Session Storage: <small>Session Storage objects can be accessed using the
                            sessionStorage read-only
                            property. The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data
                            does
                            not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.</small></p>
                    <p>Session Storage has 4 methods:</p>
                    <p>1. setItem() Method – <small>This method takes two parameters one is key and another one is
                            value. It
                            is used to store the value in a particular location with the name of the key.</small>
                        sessionStorage.setItem(key, value)</p>

                    Difference Between Global scope and Block scope?

                    <p class="text-xl">Global Scope</p>
                    <p>The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and
                        have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that
                        program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.</p>

                    <p class="text-xl">Block Scope</p>
                    <p>Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                        variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or
                        conditional
                        statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the
                        curly brackets {}.</p>

                    How does the Event Loop works in JavaScript?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content text-white">
                    <p>The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all
                        operations
                        on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of
                        multi-threading. Let’s take a look at what happens on the back-end.</p>
                    <p>The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed.
                        Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack.</p>

                    <p>The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows
                        the
                        queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for
                        execution.</p>
                    <p>An example of this is the setTimeout method. When a setTimeout operation is processed in the
                        stack,
                        it is sent to the corresponding API which waits till the specified time to send this operation
                        back
                        in for processing.</p>
                    <p>The event loop facilitates this process; it constantly checks whether or not the call stack is
                        empty.
                        If it is empty, new functions are added from the event queue. If it is not, then the current
                        function call is processed.</p>

                    How to use undefined in JavaScript?

                    <p>In this example program, we will check whether a specific variable is defined or not. If the
                        program
                        does not define the variable, display the message “variable not defined!”. Else show the message
                        “variable defined”:</p>
